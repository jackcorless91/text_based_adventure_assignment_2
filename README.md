# Text Based Adventure Game

## Before getting started we need to do some setup
This python application will be run in a virtual environment (venv) in the terminal. A venv is a mini virtual computer within your own thus creating an isolated enviorment where regardless of your computers confirgurations, downloads or settings it will run the same on all machines producing the same result. This also stops what we run here today from polluring your other projects.
